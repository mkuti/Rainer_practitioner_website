# Alternative Practitioner website
</div>
<div align="center"> 

[Website is deployed via GitHub pages here](https://mkuti.github.io/yuan-gong-and-amatsu-with-rainer/)
</div>
 
A natural and minimalist website for an alternative medicine practitioner based in Ireland. 
This practitioner is a therapist and teacher in Qigong and Amatsu but is also a qualified chef and a home gardener all related by his passion about living better, happier and in a more natural way. He knows how important it is to keep the body, mind and soul in balance which makes him very passionate to share and teach with others.

Because of the absence of knowledge and interest in these types of practices coupled with the very amateurish existing websites for those types of practices, the main goal of the website is to give a basic intro while not overloading with too much content, having a modern designed, minimalist and relaxed website for both already convinced or new clients and to guide everyone towards useful knowledge to apply or contact directly the practitioner for more.

During strategy plane of UX and while consulting the practitioner, I have come up with the main business needs for this website, as listed below:
- BUILD ONLINE PRESENCE
- INCREASE AWARENESS ABOUT BOTH PRACTICES
- INCREASE POTENTIAL CLIENTS

Other needs came up during discussion with client but could not be implemented during this project as lack of time, readiness and programming languages for now. 

# UX
__Primary target audience?__ green, nature, alternative, 30-45years old
- *Strategy* > pastel colors, background image in relation to nature and peace and tranquillity

__What is the website for?__ 
1. To answer questions about how to feel better, how to heal… 
2. and to contact the practitioner and healer to get answers and help
- *strategy* > information about practice and healing but also call to action (contact us)

__What is culturally appropriate?__ Traditional audience would not be too much into smart phone but goal is to attract young and modern audience who like fast info, color and modern design
- *strategy* > maximise the responsive design in the website so we can make a beautiful and attractive website with modern design
Not too much information and content, maybe more videos and photos

__Why is this so special?__ Because not many similar websites for alternative healing and all the existing websites are full of text and content, not very attractive
————> strategy

During my research in planning and designing the website, I asked a few questions to some friends who could be potential clients and also the practitioner himself. From those questions and my own research of other websites and practice, came the user stories below.
Before the user stories, I wanted to add here a few questions asked and their answers.

1. What does the User expect?
	* I expect a professional looking and easy to navigate website with easy to read  information and easy to find contact details.  
2. How a website should look credible and trustworthy?
	* This is very important. In my opinion websites for alternative medicine often look very dodgy, bad colours, font, very bad layout, not easy to read at all. It does not create trust. It creates the feeling that the person might not be credible at all. 
3. What do you expect?
	* A website design that is ‘on brand’ with the practice. Use modern design, clean layout. It should look a bit more like a spa website and less like a car repair website
4. How should it look valuable enough for me to stay?
	* Easy to navigate tabs, good info on how to get in touch, clear prices, testimonials from existing clients, a nice bio/about page. No advertisements
5. When you go to a particular site, where do you go first?
	* Depends on why I visited the page, but in many cases to the ‘About’ tab to find out more about the person behind the product/brand


## User Stories and Features:

During the scope plane and while establishing the user stories for each page and making wireframes, the following features were decided. 

This helped me to plan ahead and also to work through specific sprints to implement one feature at a time, answering one user story at a time... 

__For the Home page__
1. As a user, when I land on a website, I am expecting a title with a logo or a photo, so I know where I am:
	> logo with Rainer’s name which will be repeated on each page and as expected on modern website, which can take me back to Home page
2. As a general website user, when I go to any website, I usually expect a navigation bar to be at the top of the page with few menus items to navigate easily to other pages:
	> * navbar with different menu items which stay fixed on top of the page when scrolling down the page and which will appear on each page
	> * to give space, navbar will be replaced by a __burger menu__ on smaller screen and toggle down the navbar vertically
	> * to give space again, logo will disappear when scrolling down the page
	> * navbar should be a band of unified color with menu items on it
3. As someone closed to nature, I expect a full image showing nature when I arrive on the website, so I know this is related to me:
	> a full background image for home page
4. As a person looking to heal or live better, I expect to see a question related to me and my state, which can be a call for action to know more:
	> question overlaying on full screen image
5. As a potential client, when I arrive on this website, I expect to see testimonials from other clients who already had therapy sessions or lessons with this practitioner:
	> band of one testimonial at a time with a __carousel__

### List of wireframes made before building the website 

I used Balsamic tool for the wireframes and attached them to the directory in assets. I spent a considerable amount of time doing wireframes in details as I had no clue of design before and wanted to have a clear idea of how the website looked like.

- [Home](https://github.com/mkuti/milestone_1/blob/master/assets/Wireframes/Home%20Page.png)
- [Home mobile](https://github.com/mkuti/milestone_1/blob/master/assets/Wireframes/Home%20Page%20Mobile.png)
- [About Me](https://github.com/mkuti/milestone_1/blob/master/assets/Wireframes/About%20Me.png)
- [About Me mobile](https://github.com/mkuti/milestone_1/blob/master/assets/Wireframes/About%20Me%20Mobile.png)
- [Qigong](https://github.com/mkuti/milestone_1/blob/master/assets/Wireframes/Qigong.png)
- [Qigong mobile](https://github.com/mkuti/milestone_1/blob/master/assets/Wireframes/Qigong%20Mobile.png)
- [Amatsu](https://github.com/mkuti/milestone_1/blob/master/assets/Wireframes/Amatsu.png)

As always when implementing coding, these wireframes templates do not exactly reflect the final version of the website itself but they were very useful for me to have an approximate design in my head and to also share with the client. 

During mentoring session, I was for example advised to push down some content in a separate section to improve user experience because of overloaded content.

The footer changed completely during coding phase while the navbar was greatly improved thanks to more option for color and fonts.

# Technologies Used
- This website used HTML and CSS programming languages. 
- One feature also needed JS language which was provided by Simen Dehlin (mentor) via Slack
- [AWS Cloud9](https://www.awseducate.com/student/s/awssite) - I used __AWS Cloud9__ as my IDE for the development of this website.
- [BootstrapCDN](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/) - The website is using __Bootstrap4__ as the basic structure and grid of the website and to increase the responsiveness of the website.
- [FontAwesome](https://kit.fontawesome.com/f7e192f540.js) - The website is using __Font Awesome__ to display many icons on all pages
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)- The website uses __3 different Google fonts__ to style the content text and headings - Url imported in CSS
- [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/embed/7QMdT02TVnQ) - The website used __YouTube__ to host the video for the "Qigong page". 
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) and [Popper.js](https://popper.js.org/) - The website uses __jQuery__ and __Popper.js__ to bring in Javascript which makes the navbar responsive 
- [AutoPrefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) - I have used __AutoPrefixer__ to make sure the css code worked on all browsers
- [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com) - Website imported images from __Pexels__ for the full background image and all banners image
- [Tiny.jpg](https://tinyjpg.com) - I have used __Tinyjpg__ to compress all images of the website to increas the website loading on browser
- [ColorSpace](https://mycolor.space) - I have used __ColorSpace__ to find matching colors for the website
- [Balsamic](https://balsamiq.cloud) - I have used __Balsamic__ to build the wireframes which I then exported to the IDE
- [Favicon converter](https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/) - I used Favicon converter to convert the logo into a favicon which I was able to insert in the asset folder and I tested it to be working

# Testing

### Final and official testing:
  * [W3 MarkUp validation](https://validator.w3.org)
  * [W3 CSS validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

I checked the validity of my code at different times and received few errors on HTML markup which I worked on correcting. I did not get any errors with my CSS.
Example of an error in the MarkUp corrected: 
- *The frameborder attribute on the iframe element is obsolete. Use CSS instead.* I then removed frameborder from HTML and added border: none in CSS

### General testing
Since I started to build the structure of the website and added the first line of code or content, I did constant testing via the use of Chrome Developer tools.
For each feature I was working on, I tried to preview it in Chrome Dev tools to understand quickly which HTML or CSS would cause a certain effect and correct it as soon as possible. 
This allowed me to fully comprehend the languages and push to GitHub only after I made the whole feature was working well.

Generally, I quickly noticed that the tablet devices with a medium size was requiring more attention as the responsiveness was working poorly. So when I could I added more Bootstrap grid columns to fix the responsiveness.
This has been then one of my preoccupation for the whole testing.

As a general rule also, when something would not work, especially at the beginning when I tried to build it with only HTML and CSS, without BootStrap, as challenged by my mentor then, I would do the search in W3Schools, Stack Overflow and Google generally to see if other developers struggled with same issue and found solution.
Then when I could not find a solution anywhere else, I would turn to Slack and ask questions to fellow students. However, because I worked evenings mostly and did not have much opportunity to discuss my project with my mentor, I had to find solutions myself by playing around.

### Testing in different browsers

I used Google Chrome as my primary browser and constantly tested it on my mobile phone also using the same browser.
As I worked on a Mac, I also tested the website on Safari regularly and never found any specific issue.

When I asked friends to test it on Internet Explorer, it seems that some issues occurs, such as the attention text moving down when screen size was reduced on the "Home Page", the list of benefits designed as stones on "Amatsu page" show squeezed and the cards of .

As advised by Anna Greaves in her pdf document for milestone project, I used AutoPrefixer to add the appropriate vendor prefixe on css code to make sure it works on most browsers. I could not test it again on Internet Explorer to see if it is working.

At the moment the website has been tested on Safari, Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox. The website works and functions as expected on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Opera, Mozilla Firefox but has flaws on Internet Explorer.
Could not find a way to correct those errors on Internet Explorer.


### Testing for each section

Each element of each page was tested to ensure its features worked as expected and was specifically responsive on mobile and small devices. For this, I used the device selector through the
dev tools and selected each device to test each element. I also made sure to increase and decrease screen size of the browser directly to see the breakpoints and correct if needed. 
Whenever an error was noticed, I used the dev tools to apply or change certain styles and if successful, copied it to my IDE.

When the website was ready, I tested each section one by one and found singular errors

Examples of errors I found during constant testing:

1. !important was added next nav-link:hover text color as it was cancelled automatically by the Bootstrap class
2. Background-color of navbar removed on smaller screens for cleaner design > set to transparent and media query to add color
3. When I finished Amatsu page, I tested it and found that there was a slight margin on the right of the page on smaller query. After more research and more playing around, I found that the small image was not responsive which means the image was coming out of the screen and created this extra margin
4. Another margin-right appeared after Qigong page, but after testing it on Dev tools, I found that one container was not properly closed which means the padding was repeated twice

After asking for feedback from the slack community, I received a detailed feedback from Simen Dehlin and tried to correct my code based on his suggestions:
1. Consider add a closing border on about left hand side else it looks like it's floating in mid air > __done__
2. Consider make the button on the home page top slider bigger to empesie to learn more > __done__
3. Consider remove the hover effect on the font awesome icon as it looks horrible with a underline. > __done__ after research
4. Changed version of BootstrapCDN, Popper and JS based on his suggestions
5. Removed link to BootstrapCDN for Font Awesome and replaced with the new FontAwesome 5 kit script
6. Contact form did not show what was the error so could not confirm if content is valid > __done__, added "needs-validation" bootstrap class
7. Consider adding smooth-scroll to your page this will give a better UX experience > __done__
8. Removed custom css of text-center, text-uppercase, as already existing with BootStrap
9. Consider declare your font in the  body element and then override where you want a different font. This goes into DRY as you declare the code once and only override when needed. > __done__

A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:
Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.



# Media and Content origin

* The full background image and all banner images were all obtained from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com) website, via the free download option, then compressed via [Tiny.jpg](https://tinyjpg.com) and uploaded to assets/images.

* The logo was designed by Anaelle DENIKINE specifically for this project and then converted as a Favicon via https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/.

* Photo and content on AboutMe page as well as the testimonials of the Home Page were provided by the practitioner

* Other photo used on Qigong page was obtained from https://www.huffpost.com/entry/10-reasons-to-get-to-know

* Other contents about Amatsu and Qigong were all obtained from https://www.renxueinternational.org and http://www.liath.ie/, and referred directly on the website on each page



# Deployment
I have been using the Integrated development environment (IDE) [AWS Cloud9](https://www.awseducate.com/student/s/awssite) to develop this milestone project. 
After creating a new GitHub repository, I linked it on the terminal of my IDE. I could then commit any update of my code and push it to the remote repository so it could be regularly backed up and accessed by others.

To deploy the website from the GitHub repository to its published GitHub page, I followed the steps as below:

__Enabling GitHub Pages to publish site from master as a publishing source__
1. Navigate to GitHub Pages site's repository
2. Under repository name, clicked Settings
3. Used "Select source drop-down menu" to select master as my GitHub Pages publishing source
4. Clicked save 

When I submitted this Milestone project, I confirmed that the Development Branch and Master Branch are identical. 

__HOW TO RUN CODE LOCALLY__

1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository
2. Under the repository name, click Clone or download
3. In the Clone with HTTPs section, click to copy the clone URL for the repository
4. Open Terminal
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made
6. Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 2 when git clone: https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY 
7. Press Enter > Your local clone will be created.

### Work based on other code.

* I used part of the code from Resume Mini-Project for the timeline section and the social media icon (referenced as comments in css file)

* Banner image code technics found in the link below:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38038056/adding-a-background-image-just-below-the-navigation-bar

* logo disappear when scrolling down thanks to a codepen and js code created by Simen Dehlin via https://codepen.io/Eventyret/pen/RXBNaJ

* burger icon inspired from https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/jquery/navigation/hamburger-menu/
 
* trick to remove underline on font awesome icon when hover: https://codepen.io/jessicalyschik/pen/MJrwwx

* found css trick for a full background image here: https://css-tricks.com/perfect-full-page-background-image/

* found css trick to make the full background image show below the fixed navbar: https://teamtreehouse.com/community/div-hidden-below-fixed-position-navbar-clearfix-issues-with-css

* custom css of Stone Section was suggested by Simen Dehlin in slack so the stones are centered on top of each other: https://codepen.io/Eventyret/pen/PMJrNq but did not copy HTML markup
