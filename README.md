# YUAN GONG AND AMATSU WITH RAINER
</div>
<div align="center"> 

[Website is deployed via GitHub pages here](https://mkuti.github.io/milestone_1/)
</div>
 
A natural and minimalist website for an alternative medicine practitioner based in County Clare, Ireland. 
This practitioner is a therapist and teacher in Qigong and Amatsu but is also a qualified chef and a home gardener all related by his passion about living better, happier and in a more natural way. He knows how important it is to keep the body, mind and soul in balance which makes him very passionate to share and teach with others.

Because of the absence of knowledge and interest in these types of practices coupled with the very amateurish existing websites for those types of practices, the main goal of the website is to give a basic intro while not overloading with too much content, having a modern designed, minimalist and relaxed website for both already convinced or new clients and to guide everyone towards useful knowledge to apply or contact directly the practitioner for more.

# UX
__Primary target audience?__ green, nature, alternative, 30-45years old
- *Strategy* > pastel colors, background image in relation to nature and peace and tranquillity

__What is the website for?__ 
1. To answer questions about how to feel better, how to heal… 
2. and to contact the practitioner and healer to get answers and help
- *strategy* > information about practice and healing but also call to action (contact us)

__What is culturally appropriate?__ Traditional audience would not be too much into smart phone but goal is to attract young and modern audience who like fast info, color and modern design
- *strategy* > maximise the responsive design in the website so we can make a beautiful and attractive website with modern design
Not too much information and content, maybe more videos and photos

__Why is this so special?__ Because not many similar websites for alternative healing and all the existing websites are full of text and content, not very attractive
————> strategy

During my research in planning and designing the website, I asked a few questions to some friends who could be potential clients and also the practitioner himself. From those questions and my own research of other websites and practice, came the user stories below.
Before the user stories, I wanted to add here a few questions asked and their answers.

1. What does the User expect?
	* I expect a professional looking and easy to navigate website with easy to read  information and easy to find contact details.  
2. How a website should look credible and trustworthy?
	* This is very important. In my opinion websites for alternative medicine often look very dodgy, bad colours, font, very bad layout, not easy to read at all. It does not create trust. It creates the feeling that the person might not be credible at all. 
3. What do you expect?
	* A website design that is ‘on brand’ with the practice. Use modern design, clean layout. It should look a bit more like a spa website and less like a car repair website
4. How should it look valuable enough for me to stay?
	* Easy to navigate tabs, good info on how to get in touch, clear prices, testimonials from existing clients, a nice bio/about page. No advertisements
5. When you go to a particular site, where do you go first?
	* Depends on why I visited the page, but in many cases to the ‘About’ tab to find out more about the person behind the product/brand


## User Stories and Features:

During the scope plane and while establishing the user stories for each page and making wireframes, the following features were decided. 

This helped me to plan ahead and also to work through specific sprints to implement one feature at a time, answering one user story at a time... 

__For the Home page__
1. As a user, when I land on a website, I am expecting a title with a logo or a photo, so I know where I am:
	> logo with Rainer’s name which will be repeated on each page and as expected on modern website, which can take me back to Home page
2. As a general website user, when I go to any website, I usually expect a navigation bar to be at the top of the page with few menus items to navigate easily to other pages:
	> * navbar with different menu items which stay fixed on top of the page when scrolling down the page and which will appear on each page
	> * to give space, navbar will be replaced by a __burger menu__ on smaller screen and toggle down the navbar vertically
	> * to give space again, logo will disappear when scrolling down the page
	> * navbar should be a band of unified color with menu items on it
3. As someone closed to nature, I expect a full image showing nature when I arrive on the website, so I know this is related to me:
	> a full background image for home page
4. As a person looking to heal or live better, I expect to see a question related to me and my state, which can be a call for action to know more:
	> question overlaying on full screen image
5. As a potential client, when I arrive on this website, I expect to see testimonials from other clients who already had therapy sessions or lessons with this practitioner:
	> band of one testimonial at a time with a __carousel__
6. As generally unaware of alternative therapies, when I land on this website, I expect to have a quick intro about what is the website about:
	> brief intro about Qigong and Amatsu with link to full pages (call to action) below the testimonials
7. As someone interested by Qigong and want to find more, I want to find a quick link to get more information in the navbar:
	> a direct navlink in the navbar about Qigong to bring to another page
8. As someone looking to receive Amatsu therapy session, I want to find a quick link to get more information and book a session in the navbar:
	> a direct navlink in the navbar about Amatsu to open another page 
9. As a usual website user, I expect a contact call for action button so I can go further and reach out to the practitioner:
	> Contact Me button at the right side of the navbar
10. As a usual website user, when I visit any website, I expect a footer with social media links to have more way to reach out to practitioner:
	> one small band of footer with social media links

__About Me Page__
1. As a potential client, when I visit a website about a practitioner:
 * I want to know more about the person and the qualifications so I know if I can relate and rely on him and his skills: 
    > About me page accessible from the navlink
	> a nice photo of the practitioner

 * I want to find out more about his life, his journey to the two practices he is passionate about:
 
    > The page includes a __timeline__ of Rainer’s life

    > a brief intro about his background, his other skills and how it is all related by a common passion

    > a resume of his qualifications

__Qigong page__
1. As someone interested by Qigong, I want to have more general information about the practice but also the specific teaching followed by this specific practitioner. 
	> * Qigong accessible from the navlink
	> * general introduction about Qigong practice
	> * Yuan Gong and Ren Xue movement - follow up of general intro
	> * a video of Qigong movement
2. As someone looking to get healed or eager to improve his well-being, I do not know Qigong so a brief intro would be helpful on the Homepage. And when I come to the specific page of Qigong, expecting to have basic steps of Qigong to follow so I can start my journey
	> * Button to find more about Qigong in the brief intro of the homepage
	> * one easy exercise to follow and start Qigong journey
	> * a video of Qigong movement

__Amatsu page__
1. As someone interested by Amatsu, when I come to this website, I expect to find more general information about the therapy and more importantly how to book a session with the practitioner
 	> * Amatsu directly accessible from the navbar as a menu item
	> * simple timetable of practitioner (to be implemented at a later stage)
	> * in the Amatsu page, I can “book a session” by filling a simple form
2. As someone looking to get treated for a specific pain but I do not know what is Amatsu, a brief intro would be helpful on the Homepage. And when I come to the specific page of Amatsu, expecting to have more information about how the practitioner shows his skills and maybe to explain how a session happens + I can book a session directly on the page
	> * Button to find more about Amatsu in the brief intro of the homepage
	> * photo of practitioner giving Amatsu treatment next to brief explanation of a session timeline
	> * in the Amatsu page, I can “book a session” by filling a simple form


__List of wireframes made before building the website__ 

I used Balsamic tool for the wireframes and attached them to the directory in assets. I spent a considerable amount of time doing wireframes in details as I had no clue of design before and wanted to have a clear idea of how the website looked like.

- [Home](https://github.com/mkuti/milestone_1/blob/master/assets/Wireframes/Home%20Page.png)
- [Home mobile](https://github.com/mkuti/milestone_1/blob/master/assets/Wireframes/Home%20Page%20Mobile.png)
- [About Me](https://github.com/mkuti/milestone_1/blob/master/assets/Wireframes/About%20Me.png)
- [About Me mobile](https://github.com/mkuti/milestone_1/blob/master/assets/Wireframes/About%20Me%20Mobile.png)
- [Qigong](https://github.com/mkuti/milestone_1/blob/master/assets/Wireframes/Qigong.png)
- [Qigong mobile](https://github.com/mkuti/milestone_1/blob/master/assets/Wireframes/Qigong%20Mobile.png)
- [Amatsu](https://github.com/mkuti/milestone_1/blob/master/assets/Wireframes/Amatsu.png)

As always when implementing coding, these wireframes templates do not exactly reflect the final version of the website itself but they were very useful for me to have an approximate design in my head and to also share with the client. 

During mentoring session, I was for example advised to push down some content in a separate section to improve user experience because of overloaded content.

The footer changed completely during coding phase while the navbar was greatly improved thanks to more option for color and fonts.

# Media and Content origin

* The full background image and all banner images were all obtained from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com) website, via the free download option, then compressed via [Tiny.jpg](https://tinyjpg.com) and uploaded to assets/images.

* The logo was designed by Anaelle DENIKINE specifically for this project and then converted as a Favicon via https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/.

* Photo and content on AboutMe page as well as the testimonials of the Home Page were provided by the practitioner

* Other photo used on Qigong page was obtained from https://www.huffpost.com/entry/10-reasons-to-get-to-know

* The video on the Qigong page is from https://www.renxueinternational.org

* Other contents about Amatsu and Qigong were all obtained from https://www.renxueinternational.org and http://www.liath.ie/, and referred directly on the website on each page

# Testing

* __Final and official testing__: 
  * [W3 MarkUp validation](https://validator.w3.org)
  * [W3 CSS validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

I checked the validity of my code at different times and received few errors on HTML markup which I worked on correcting. I did not get any errors with my CSS.
Example of an error in the MarkUp corrected: 
- *The frameborder attribute on the iframe element is obsolete. Use CSS instead.* I then removed frameborder from HTML and added border: none in CSS



Since I started to build the structure of the website and add the first line of code or content, I have done constant testing via the use of Chrome Developer tools.
Starting from the mobile-first side of things each element on each page was tested to ensure it functions as expected. Using the device selector through the
dev tools, each device was selected to achieve the testing needed. If and when I encountered an error, I would first try to alleviate that error through the 
accompanying elements panel, and if successful replicate the fix in my IDE. If an error could not be fixed, my focus would turn to Slack and my fellow Code Institute
students for help with identifying the problem and advice for tackling same.

# Acknowledgements

- I received inspiration for this project from Rainer Puehringer who is the practitioner showcased on the website and who was kind enough to explain briefly the practices and share contents for the website.
- To Anaelle for designing the logo of the website so efficiently and who managed to make a beautiful one, reflecting the ambiance of the website by using same colors. She also helped me to test website and provided feedback throughout the project time.
- To Anna G., other student on Slack channel who encouraged me during research and design, thanks to her lead sessions, all resources she provided to build a kick-ass milestone project, and for answering questions... Although I never copied anything, some of my website design got inspired from her website.
- To Simen Dehlin for answering technical questions, helping me to tackle two CSS queries and provided CodePen examples which I referred on the style.css via comment and for providing a very detailed feedback on the website! 
- To Anthony, current lead for usercentric slack channel, who provided such a useful resource for research and tools. This will follow me through all milestones!

__Thank you all!__
